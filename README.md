# NeoVim-Init
---
My personal nvim init.

Be sure to utilize NeoVim 0.7+

## Install location

- Windows <br>
```
~/AppDatat/Local/nvim/init.vim
```

- Linux <br>
```
~/.config/nvim/init.vim
```

## Instructions
Launching once will get the plugin manager installed.
On second launch you will be able to run `PlugInstall`

### Windows
On windows, you will need to install clang compiler if you want to use orgmode. Tree-sitter requires clang compiler.
You can find assistance [here](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/wiki/Windows-support)

Will need to have visual studio installed so that you can access the x64 native prompt
